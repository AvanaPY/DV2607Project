# DV2607 - Project




## Setting up 

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.

## This project uses a custom version of OpenAI's Whisper AI

If installing the custom DV2607 version of Whisper should fail, try to remove it from the requirements.txt file and run `pip3 install https://github.com/AvanaPY/DV2607Whisper.git" instead, and once again run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
